Open Telegram and search for "BotFather."

Start a chat with BotFather and follow its instructions to create a new bot. You'll receive a bot token which you'll need for your code.

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Install the node-telegram-bot-api package which simplifies interaction with Telegram's API:

npm install node-telegram-bot-api

Replace with your own token:

const token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN';
